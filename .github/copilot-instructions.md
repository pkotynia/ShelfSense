{{project-description}}

## CODING_PRACTICES

### Guidelines for SUPPORT_LEVEL

#### SUPPORT_BEGINNER

- When running in agent mode, execute up to 3 actions at a time and ask for approval or course correction afterwards.
- Write code with clear variable names and include explanatory comments for non-obvious logic. Avoid shorthand syntax and complex patterns.
- Provide full implementations rather than partial snippets. Include import statements, required dependencies, and initialization code.
- Add defensive coding patterns and clear error handling. Include validation for user inputs and explicit type checking.
- Suggest simpler solutions first, then offer more optimized versions with explanations of the trade-offs.
- Briefly explain why certain approaches are used and link to relevant documentation or learning resources.
- When suggesting fixes for errors, explain the root cause and how the solution addresses it to build understanding. Ask for confirmation before proceeding.
- Offer introducing basic test cases that demonstrate how the code works and common edge cases to consider.


## BACKEND

### Guidelines for PYTHON

#### FASTAPI

- Use Pydantic models for request and response validation with strict type checking and custom validators
- Implement dependency injection for services and database sessions to improve testability and resource management
- Use async endpoints for I/O-bound operations to improve throughput for {{high_load_endpoints}}
- Leverage FastAPI's background tasks for non-critical operations that don't need to block the response
- Implement proper exception handling with HTTPException and custom exception handlers for {{error_scenarios}}
- Use path operation decorators consistently with appropriate HTTP methods (GET for retrieval, POST for creation, etc.)

## DATABASE

### Guidelines for SQL

#### POSTGRES

- Use connection pooling to manage database connections efficiently
- Implement JSONB columns for semi-structured data instead of creating many tables for {{flexible_data}}
- Use materialized views for complex, frequently accessed read-only data

## DEVOPS

### Guidelines for CI_CD

#### GITHUB_ACTIONS

- Check if `package.json` exists in project root and summarize key scripts
- Check if `.nvmrc` exists in project root
- Check if `.env.example` exists in project root to identify key `env:` variables
- Always use terminal command: `git branch -a | cat` to verify whether we use `main` or `master` branch
- Always use `env:` variables and secrets attached to jobs instead of global workflows
- Always use `npm ci` for Node-based dependency setup
- Extract common steps into composite actions in separate files
- Once you're done, as a final step conduct the following: for each public action always use <tool>"Run Terminal"</tool> to see what is the most up-to-date version (use only major version) - extract tag_name from the response:
- ```bash curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/releases/latest ```

## FRONTEND

### Guidelines for REACT

#### REACT_CODING_STANDARDS

- Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
- Implement React.memo() for expensive components that render often with the same props
- Utilize React.lazy() and Suspense for code-splitting and performance optimization
- Use the useCallback hook for event handlers passed to child components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Prefer useMemo for expensive calculations to avoid recomputation on every render
- Implement useId() for generating unique IDs for accessibility attributes
- Use the new use hook for data fetching in React 19+ projects
- Leverage Server Components for {{data_fetching_heavy_components}} when using React with Next.js or similar frameworks
- Consider using the new useOptimistic hook for optimistic UI updates in forms
- Use useTransition for non-urgent state updates to keep the UI responsive

## FRONTEND

### Guidelines for REACT

#### REACT_ROUTER

- Use createBrowserRouter instead of BrowserRouter for better data loading and error handling
- Implement lazy loading with React.lazy() for route components to improve initial load time
- Use the useNavigate hook instead of the navigate component prop for programmatic navigation
- Leverage loader and action functions to handle data fetching and mutations at the route level
- Implement error boundaries with errorElement to gracefully handle routing and data errors
- Use relative paths with dot notation (e.g., "../parent") to maintain route hierarchy flexibility
- Utilize the useRouteLoaderData hook to access data from parent routes
- Implement fetchers for non-navigation data mutations
- Use route.lazy() for route-level code splitting with automatic loading states
- Implement shouldRevalidate functions to control when data revalidation happens after navigation

## FRONTEND

### Guidelines for STYLING

#### TAILWIND

- Use the @layer directive to organize styles into components, utilities, and base layers
- Implement Just-in-Time (JIT) mode for development efficiency and smaller CSS bundles
- Use arbitrary values with square brackets (e.g., w-[123px]) for precise one-off designs
- Leverage the @apply directive in component classes to reuse utility combinations
- Implement the Tailwind configuration file for customizing theme, plugins, and variants
- Use component extraction for repeated UI patterns instead of copying utility classes
- Leverage the theme() function in CSS for accessing Tailwind theme values
- Implement dark mode with the dark: variant
- Use responsive variants (sm:, md:, lg:, etc.) for adaptive designs
- Leverage state variants (hover:, focus:, active:, etc.) for interactive elements

## TESTING

### Guidelines for E2E

#### PLAYWRIGHT

- Initialize configuration only with Chromium/Desktop Chrome browser
- Use browser contexts for isolating test environments
- Implement the Page Object Model for maintainable tests
- Use locators for resilient element selection
- Leverage API testing for backend validation
- Implement visual comparison with expect(page).toHaveScreenshot()
- Use the codegen tool for test recording
- Leverage trace viewer for debugging test failures
- Implement test hooks for setup and teardown
- Use expect assertions with specific matchers
- Leverage parallel execution for faster test runs

## TESTING

### Guidelines for UNIT

#### MOCHA

- Use Chai for assertions and Sinon for mocks and spies
- Implement the AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) pattern for test structure
- Use before/after hooks for setup and teardown of {{test_dependencies}}

## TESTING

### Guidelines for UNIT

#### VITEST

- Leverage the `vi` object for test doubles - Use `vi.fn()` for function mocks, `vi.spyOn()` to monitor existing functions, and `vi.stubGlobal()` for global mocks. Prefer spies over mocks when you only need to verify interactions without changing behavior.
- Master `vi.mock()` factory patterns - Place mock factory functions at the top level of your test file, return typed mock implementations, and use `mockImplementation()` or `mockReturnValue()` for dynamic control during tests. Remember the factory runs before imports are processed.
- Create setup files for reusable configuration - Define global mocks, custom matchers, and environment setup in dedicated files referenced in your `vitest.config.ts`. This keeps your test files clean while ensuring consistent test environments.
- Use inline snapshots for readable assertions - Replace complex equality checks with `expect(value).toMatchInlineSnapshot()` to capture expected output directly in your test file, making changes more visible in code reviews.
- Monitor coverage with purpose and only when asked - Configure coverage thresholds in `vitest.config.ts` to ensure critical code paths are tested, but focus on meaningful tests rather than arbitrary coverage percentages.
- Make watch mode part of your workflow - Run `vitest --watch` during development for instant feedback as you modify code, filtering tests with `-t` to focus on specific areas under development.
- Explore UI mode for complex test suites - Use `vitest --ui` to visually navigate large test suites, inspect test results, and debug failures more efficiently during development.
- Handle optional dependencies with smart mocking - Use conditional mocking to test code with optional dependencies by implementing `vi.mock()` with the factory pattern for modules that might not be available in all environments.
- Configure jsdom for DOM testing - Set `environment: 'jsdom'` in your configuration for frontend component tests and combine with testing-library utilities for realistic user interaction simulation.
- Structure tests for maintainability - Group related tests with descriptive `describe` blocks, use explicit assertion messages, and follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern to make tests self-documenting.
- Leverage TypeScript type checking in tests - Enable strict typing in your tests to catch type errors early, use `expectTypeOf()` for type-level assertions, and ensure mocks preserve the original type signatures.



## CODING_PRACTICES

### Guidelines for STATIC_ANALYSIS

#### ESLINT

- Configure project-specific rules in eslint.config.js to enforce consistent coding standards
- Use shareable configs like eslint-config-airbnb or eslint-config-standard as a foundation
- Implement custom rules for {{project_specific_patterns}} to maintain codebase consistency
- Configure integration with Prettier to avoid rule conflicts for code formatting
- Use the --fix flag in CI/CD pipelines to automatically correct fixable issues
- Implement staged linting with husky and lint-staged to prevent committing non-compliant code

## CODING_PRACTICES

### Guidelines for VERSION_CONTROL

#### GIT

- Use conventional commits to create meaningful commit messages
- Use feature branches with descriptive names following {{branch_naming_convention}}
- Write meaningful commit messages that explain why changes were made, not just what
- Keep commits focused on single logical changes to facilitate code review and bisection
- Use interactive rebase to clean up history before merging feature branches
- Leverage git hooks to enforce code quality checks before commits and pushes
